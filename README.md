# Bootstrap components for Angular 2 inspired by material2

Implement Bootstrap components using core material2 logic.

## Why?
The material design implementation for angular 1 is a super high quality 
implementation of UI components, that's not surprising since Google
maintain's it.

Implementing A bootstrap component library based on the core foundation
of material2 means less work, less challenges and better output.

## How?
By porting the `@angular-material/core` packages.
Since `@angular-material/core` is tightly coupled with material it has
to be ported.
This is not a copy/paste task, each component in `@angular-material/core` 
has to be evaluated and ported to fit bootstrap concepts.
